TODOS:
+ negative rotations set wrong order of elements in cube (maybe just make three normal rotations 90deg) ++ ugly solution but working
+ add interpolation to rotations (add slerp) ++
- make rotation even (so far so good maybe some tuning in slerp)
- add control panel to rotate layers
- recoginze which wall is facing foront to rotate wall according to frontal wall
- add scrambling, and editor 
+ styles - looks good for me XD
- refactor
+ still rotattion of wrong cubelets sometimes -- hope its done
- dont calculate frames when no action performed
- fix scaling
